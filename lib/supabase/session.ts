/**
 * Session-aware Supabase client for the admin area. It reads the signed-in
 * user's auth cookies, so it must be created per request and its results
 * must never be cached or shared ("use cache" scopes can't read cookies, by
 * design). The anonymous catalogue client in ./server.ts is kept separate.
 *
 * In Server Components cookies can't be written; the session is refreshed
 * by proxy.ts before the page renders. Server Actions can write them, which
 * is how sign-in and sign-out set and clear the session.
 *
 * Supabase Auth compares the token's expiry with Date.now() as soon as the
 * client is created and on every session read. cookies() alone still allows
 * a runtime prefetch, where the current time isn't available, so wait for
 * the actual request first.
